### Problems Faced 😞

- The mode of attendance in our institute is still pen and paper based which is age old.
- Attendance sheet can be easily manipulated
- Attendance sheets either take a lot of time or causes disturbance in the lecture

### How this App Solves It

- New age mechanism
- Can be done synchronously so saves time
- Easy to understand interface for the instructor as well

### Tech Stack

- Flutter
- Supabase
